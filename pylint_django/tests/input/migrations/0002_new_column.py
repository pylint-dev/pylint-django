"""
Migration file which adds a new column with a default value.
This should trigger a warning because adding new columns with
default value on a large table leads to DB performance issues.

See:
https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/118 and
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/migrations/#postgresql

> ... adding columns with default values will cause a full rewrite of
> the table, for a time proportional to its size.
> For this reason, itâ€™s recommended you always create new columns with
> null=True, as this way they will be added immediately.

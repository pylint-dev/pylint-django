Version 0.6
-----------

-  Pylint 1.4 dropped support for Python 2.6, therefore a constraint is
   added that pylint-django will only work with Python2.6 if pylint<=1.3
   is installed
-  `#40 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/40>`__ - pylint
   1.4 warned about View and Model classes not having enough public

   infinite loop when using astroid 1.3.3+

   ``ForeignKey`` transforms, which now work when of the form
   ``othermodule.ModelClass``. This also fixes a problem where an
   inferred type would be ``_Yes`` and pylint would fail
-  `PR #28 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/pull/28>`__ - better
   knowledge of ``ManyToManyField`` classes

Version 0.5.4
-------------

-  Improved resiliance to inference failure when Django types cannot be
   inferred (which can happen if Django is not on the system path

Version 0.5.3
-------------

-  `Issue #25 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/25>`__
   Fixing cases where a module defines ``get`` as a method

Version 0.5.2
-------------

-  Fixed a problem where type inference could get into an infinite loop

Version 0.5.1
-------------

-  Removed usage of a Django object, as importing it caused Django to
   try to configure itself and thus throw an ImproperlyConfigured
   exception.

Version 0.5
-----------

-  `Issue #7 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/7>`__
   Improved handling of Django model fields
-  `Issue #10 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/10>`__ No
   warning about missing **unicode** if the Django python3/2
   compatability tools are used

   Improved handling of Django form fields

   Improved handling of Django ImageField and FileField objects
-  `Issue #14 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/14>`__
   Models which do not define **unicode** but whose parents do now have
   a new error (W5103) instead of incorrectly warning about no
   **unicode** being present.
-  `Issue #21 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/21>`__
   ``ForeignKey`` and ``OneToOneField`` fields on models are replaced
   with instance of the type they refer to in the AST, which allows
   pylint to generate correct warnings about attributes they may or may
   not have.

Version 0.3
-----------

-  Python3 is now supported
-  ``__unicode__`` warning on models does not appear in Python3

Version 0.2
-----------

-  Pylint now recognises ``BaseForm`` as an ancestor of ``Form`` and
   subclasses
-  Improved ``Form`` support
-  `Issue #2 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/2>`__ - a
   subclass of a ``Model`` or ``Form`` also has warnings about a
   ``Meta`` class suppressed.
-  `Issue #3 <https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint-django/issues/3>`__ -
   ``Form`` and ``ModelForm`` subclasses no longer warn about ``Meta``
   classes.
